Given jobs and candidates data with the fields mentioned below, create a recommendation system that categorizes a given set of candidates across the job pool. For training the model, you have to extrapolate the provided sample data.

Job Fields (in "Job_Pool" sheet)
- Designation
- Required Skills
- Minimum Experience in Months
- Maximum Experience in Months

Candidate Data fields (in "CV_Pool" sheet)
- Skills
- Designation
- Industry
- Experience in Months
- Institute
- Degree

Mapping between jobs and candidates (in "Job_CV_Mapping" sheet)
- Job Id and corresponding relevant Candidate Ids

Output Format:
Print all relevant candidates for each job in their matching magnitude order after extrapolating given job and candidate pools in "dataset_sample.xls".

Note:
1. Refer to "dataset_sample.xls" for the sample dataset. Note that this is not the complete dataset, you are required to extrapolate the existing dataset to form training and testing datasets and then create a POC.

2. Please note it is important that you augment your analysis with comments and a summary about how you approached the problem.

3. For brownie points:
   a. Suggest how can you modify the existing features to optimize your solution
   b. Include neural nets in your analysis

4. We have added some bias in our data and expect you to include some bias in your dataset after extrapolation

5. Ranking the CVs for a job will be given additional points
